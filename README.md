# GGG - Guessing game in Go

This project is a proof-of-concept work to implement network communication
between several devices.

Functionally, it consists in a guessing game whose rules are simple: one player
makes the others guess an idea (be it a character, animal, or object) by
answering questions with only *Yes* or *No*. Each guessing player in turn asks
questions in turn, and as long as the answer is *Yes*; when it is *No* the next
player's turn begins.
